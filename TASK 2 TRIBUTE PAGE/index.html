                <h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
                <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                    pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State
                    of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, his
                    mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth
                    between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and
                    one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
                    numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal
                    Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business
                    had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as
                    well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to
                    the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost
                    by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was
                    born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income.</p>

                <h3>Career as a scientist</h3>
                <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical
                    Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information
                    Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research &
                    Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained
                    unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
                    Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S.
                    Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was
                    transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of
                    India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in
                    near-earth orbit in July 1980, Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
                    independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the
                    programme to include more engineers.</p>

                <h3> Presidency</h3>
                <p>Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential
                    election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His
                    term lasted from 25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007. <br>
                    On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed
                    that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,and both the Samajwadi Party and the
                    Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. After the Samajwadi Party announced its support for
                    Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear. Kalam said of
                    the announcement of his candidature: <br>
                    <i>I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a
                        message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this
                        juncture.</i><br>
                    On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and
                    his senior Cabinet colleagues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h3>Post-presidency</h3>
                <p>After leaving office, Kalam became a visiting professor at the Indian Institute of Management
                    Shillong, the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and the Indian Institute of Management
                    Indore; an honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, chancellor of the Indian
                    Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram, professor of Aerospace Engineering at
                    Anna University, and an adjunct at many other academic and research institutions across India. He
                    taught information technology at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad,
                    and technology at Banaras Hindu University and Anna University. <br>
                    In 2011, Kalam was criticised by civil groups over his stand on the Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant,
                    he supported the establishment of the nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the
                    local people.The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist and
                    were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.</p>

            <div class="block">
                <h3>Death</h3>
                <p>On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet
                    Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he
                    experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35
                    p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany
                    Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[86]
                    Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest
                    at 7:45 p.m. IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: <i>"Funny guy! Are
                        you doing well?"</i> </p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <h3>Personal life</h3>
                <p>Kalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d. 1997),
                    followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Muthu Meera Lebbai Maraikayar (5 November 1916 - 7 March
                    2021), Mustafa Kalam (d. 1999) and Kasim Mohammed (d. 1995).He was extremely close to his elder
                    siblings and their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of
                    money to his older relations, himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.</p>
